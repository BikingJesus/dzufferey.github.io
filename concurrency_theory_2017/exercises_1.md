# Homework 1

_Instructions_
* Due on November 2nd (after the holidays).
* Send your solution by email to Ivan Gavran.
* You can work in groups up to 3 people, be sure to include the names of all the participants.
* You can submit your solution in pdf, markdown, or text format. For the exercises using Spin give the promela source file as well. Place all your files in a single archive (zip or tar.gz).


## Determinization and complexity

Recall the "1 as the 3rd symbol before the end" NFA:

```
      1     0,1    0,1
→ (a) → (b)  →  (c) →  ((d))
   ↺
   0,1
```

* Determinize this NFA and give an equivalent DFA.
* What is the complexity of the construction? (hint: try the example with "4th, 5th, ... before the end")
* [Optional] Is is possible to do better? Why?


## Correctness of the determinization construction

Complete the proof of correctness of the determinization construction.

Let `N` be a NFA and `D` be a DFA obtained from `N` using the powerset construction.
Show that any word accepted by `D` is also accepted by `N`: `w ∈ L(D) ⇒ w ∈ L(N)`.


## Encoding program as automaton

Recall the lock automaton:

```
       lock
→ ((u))  ⇄  ((l))
       unlock
```

And the increment program:
```
int balance;

void increase(int x) {
    lock();
    balance += x;
    unlock();
}
```
and the corresponding CFA:
```
→ ((0))
    ↓ lock
  ((1))
    ↓ balance += x
  ((2))
    ↓ unlock
  ((3))
```

Generalize this example with two (or more) increment program while keeping a single lock.
Make sure your solution preserves the mutual exclusion property of the lock.
You are allowed to change the automata (states, alphabet, transition, etc.)


## Dining philosophers in Spin

* Encode the [dining philosopher problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) in Spin (4 philosophers).
* Show it has a deadlock.
* What happens to the running time when you increase the number of philosophers?


## [Optional] Lamport's backery

* Encode [Lamport's bakery algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport%27s_bakery_algorithm) in Spin.
* Can you prove it safe? (Caveat: be sure the search depth is enough to explore the full state space, you can change it with `-mN` option where `N` is the depth.)

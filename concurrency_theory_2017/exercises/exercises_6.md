## WQO and powerset

Let us look in more details at a particular type of WQO that is well behaved with respect to powerset.

Let `X` be a finite set and `≤` a quasi-order on `X`.
* Show that `(X,≤)` is a WQO
* Show that `(2^X,⊑)` is a WQO (``P ⊑ Q ⇔ ∀ q ∈ Q. ∃ p ∈ P. p ≤ Q``)
* Show that `(2^X,⊆)` is a WQO


## Backward vs forward search

We saw two approach to the coverability problem for Petri nets:
1. forward search (Kark-Miller tree)
2. backward search (covering algorithm for WSTS)

Forward and backward analysis can behave very differentely on different nets.

* Can you find a small Petri net (with just a few places) such that the forward search is very efficient (stops after a few iterations) and the backward search is slow (> 100 iterations)?
* Can you find a small Petri net (with just a few places) such that the backward search is very efficient (stops after a few iterations) and the forward search is slow (> 100 iterations)?


## Optimizing the Karp-Miller Tree algorithm

Let us look at the ideal KM tree from [notes 5](https://github.com/dzufferey/dzufferey.github.io/blob/master/concurrency_theory_2017/notes_5.md):

```
    Input: very-WSTS 𝓢 completion-post-effective and ∞-completion-effective, initial state s₀
    Output: the covering set of 𝓢

    𝓒 := the completion of 𝓢

 1: initialize a tree T with an unmarked node (↓s₀, 0)
 2: while T contains an unmarked node c: (I, n) do
 3:     if c has an ancestor (I′, n′) s.t. I′ = I then mark c
 4:     else
 5:         if c has an ancestor c′: (I′, n′) s.t. I′ ⊂ I  ∧  n′ = n
 6:             w ← sequence of labels from c′ to c
 7:             replace c: (I, n) by (post_𝓒^∞(I, w), n + 1)
 8:         for a ∈ Σ do
 9:             for J ∈ post_𝓒(I, a)
10:                 T := T ∪ ((I,n), a, (J,n))
11:         mark c
12: return ⋃_{(I,n) ∈ T} I
```

_Remark._
When asked to justify in the following questions, we do not expect a complete proof due to the complexity of the problem ( You are welcome to try though :) ).
If you think the claim is true then you should explain your approach to showing why it is true and, maybe, try to give a proof sketch.
If you think the claim is false then you should try to give a counterexample or explain what you think breaks.

### Optimization 1

Because larger states give rise to more behaviors, we can stop the search early when we see smaller states.
On line `3` of the algorithm, let us replace `I′ = I` by `I′ ≥ I`.
Is the algorithm still solving the covering problem? Justify.
    
[Optional]
By looking at the paper [Forward Analysis for WSTS, Part III: Karp-Miller Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07258).
Can you suggest are reason why the authors use `=` and not `≥`?


### Optimization 2


Using the same idea that larger states give rise to more behaviors, we can prune the search by
1. stopping the search when another branch already contains a larger state,
2. removing smaller states and their successors in other branches of the tree.
We get a new algorithm call the minimal coverability tree algorithm.

```
    Input: very-WSTS 𝓢 completion-post-effective and ∞-completion-effective, initial state s₀
    Output: the covering set of 𝓢

    𝓒 := the completion of 𝓢

 1: initialize a tree T with an unmarked node (↓s₀, 0)
 2: while T contains an unmarked node c: (I, n) do
 3:     if there is a node c′: (I′, n′) s.t. I′ = I then mark c
 ⅰ:     else if there is a node c′: (I′, n′) s.t. I ⊂ I′ then
 ⅱ:         remove from T the subtree starting at c (including c)
 5:     else if c has an ancestor c′: (I′, n′) s.t. I′ ⊂ I  ∧  n′ = n
 6:         w ← sequence of labels from c′ to c
 7:         replace c: (I, n) by (post_𝓒^∞(I, w), n + 1)
 a:         let c′: (I′, n′) be the oldest ancestor s.t. I′ ⊂ I (if it exists)
 b:             remove from T the subtree starting at c′ (but keep c′)
 c:             replace c′ by c in T
 d:         for each c′: (I′, n′) s.t. I′ ⊂ I  /*any node, not only the ancestors*/
 e:             remove from T the subtree starting at c′ (including c′)
 f:     else
 8:         for a ∈ Σ do
 9:             for J ∈ post_𝓒(I, a)
10:                 T := T ∪ ((I,n), a, (J,n))
11:         mark c
12: return ⋃_{(I,n) ∈ T} I
```

There are three main changes:
* the line `ⅰ-ⅱ` stop the search is if a larger node already exists,
* the lines `a-e` are the new code that prune the search, and
* The acceleration (`5-7`) and computation of the successors (`8-11`) occurs in different branches.
  The nodes are not marked after the acceleration and the computation of the post only occurs when there is not acceleration possible.
  A node is marked after the successors have been added.
  The acceleration does not mark the nodes.

Is the algorithm still solving the covering problem? Justify.

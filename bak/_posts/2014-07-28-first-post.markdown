That was easy!
It is was just a competition between the me that wanted to do this for some time now and the me that always find something more pressing to do.

While working some different projects, I realized that I was copy-pasting quite a bit of code from projects to projects and that it would make sense to spin-off those parts into independent libraries.
Hopefully, other people might find those useful.

Stay tuned for more details soon.

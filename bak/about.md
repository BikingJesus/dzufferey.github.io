Hi. I am Damien Zufferey and this is my blog. (What a surprise!)
I am computer scientist and I specialize in the field of software analysis, and programming languages.
In case you are interested or just too curious, you can find more information on my academic web page: [people.csail.mit.edu/zufferey/](http://people.csail.mit.edu/zufferey/).

Usually, I am busy writing some code or a paper.
Basically running from deadlines to deadlines.
However, I will try to stop here from time to time to post some info about some of my ongoing projects (and other rambling).
